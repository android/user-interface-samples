Jetpack WindowManager Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates how to use the new Jetpack WindowManager library.
This library allows an application to support new device form factors as well as
provide a common API surface for new Window Manager features throughout old and
new platform versions. The initial release as well as this sample focuses on
foldable devices, and will be extended to support more display types and window
features.

You can find Jetpack WindowManager information in the Guide: [**Learn about foldables**][0].
