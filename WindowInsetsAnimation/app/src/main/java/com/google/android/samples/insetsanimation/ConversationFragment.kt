         * use in this sample is that the user can drag open the IME, by over-scrolling the
         * conversation RecyclerView. To enable this, we use a [InsetsAnimationLinearLayout] as a
         * root view in our layout which handles this automatically for scrolling views,

         * views, detecting raw drag events rather than scroll events to open/close the IME.

         * class bundled in this sample called [SimpleImeAnimationController], which simplifies
