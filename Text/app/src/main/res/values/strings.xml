        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
        nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had
        no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without
        pictures or conversations?”\n\n
        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel
        very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the
        trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes
        ran close by her.\n\n
        There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the
        way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought
        it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
        time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its
        waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
        flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
        waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
        the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole
        under the hedge.\n\n
        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was
        to get out again.\n\n
        The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down,
        so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found
        herself falling down a very deep well.
